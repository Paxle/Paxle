DB4O is licensed under the GPL, which is probably not compatible with Paxle's CPL.

In 2006 another licensing option was announced, see http://www.db4o.com/about/news/newsletter/2007_01.aspx and http://best-practice-software-engineering.blogspot.com/2006/12/tech-db4o-license-issues.html

"-- dOCL, THE NEW db4o OPEN SOURCE COMPATIBILITY LICENSE --

db4o has issued a third licensing option for free/open source projects that want to embed db4o but do not want to (or are not able to) license their derivative work under the GPL in its entirety. This initiative aims to proliferate db4o into many more open source projects by providing compatibility for projects licensed under Apache, LGPL, BSD, EPL, and others, as required by our users.

In order to receive the benefits from this licensing option, you simply need to register your open source project in the Projects section by mailing to community@db4o.com and thus accepting the licensing terms of the new "dOCL" agreement."
