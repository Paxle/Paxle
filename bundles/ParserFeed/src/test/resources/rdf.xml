<content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remaining 3 “major” labels – Universal, Sony and
EMI - will be out of the classical business within 2 years. They will
create no more than a handful of additional classical CDs. With the
possible exception of a few “crossover” artists the labels will drop
all of their classical artists. The majors will focus on trying to
salvage their pop business and will abandon classical because it is
more trouble than it is worth. The 20th century recording industry and
business model is obsolete. It will soon be gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;The
remaining viable classical label will be Naxos. Their costs are
dramatically lower and their business model allows them to operate
profitably in a smaller industry and with much lower sales numbers. A
primary contributor to Naxos’ lower costs is the fact that they don’t
pay any residuals to the performers. &lt;strong&gt;There is no income potential for performers in the Naxos model!&lt;/strong&gt; They will profitably produce CDs for several years longer than the majors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;There
will be a small number of “vanity” labels left but their volume will be
microscopic and they will operate on the same financial model as Naxos.
They will ultimately disappear as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Virtually
the entire recorded history of classical music will vanish from the
world. None of the pre-2000 material had digital rights cleared when it
was recorded and the cost of clearing these rights now dwarfs any
income that could result. There is no commercially viable model for
reviving this material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Here is &lt;a href=&quot;http://businessofclassicalmusic.blogspot.com/2008/12/classical-music-after-cd.html&quot;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt;, interesting throughout and the comments are excellent.&amp;nbsp; The author does suggest that live concerts still will be broadcast over the web and in some other ways marketed.&amp;nbsp; An alternative is that governments assign the digital rights unilaterally or the whole model goes grey/illegal as people dump their CD content onto web sites.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore I don&#39;t think recorded classical music will disappear, as the independent labels continue to issue releases, the demise of recording has been forecast for a long time, and my copy of &lt;em&gt;Fanfare&lt;/em&gt; (classic music reviews) is much thicker now than two years ago.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

followed by text messages, Harry Potter and song lyrics. Magazines like
Zoo and Nuts are number seven. To impress a teenage girl, it is the
same top two, followed by song lyrics, cookery books and Harry Potter.
Reassuringly, Jane Austen is number seven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3702084/Men-lie-about-books-they-have-read-to-impress-on-dates.html&quot;&gt;the actual lists&lt;/a&gt; but of course I believe people are lying about those too.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

<content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors may have been duped because Mr. Madoff sent detailed
brokerage statements to investors whose money he managed, sometimes
reporting hundreds of individual stock trades per month. Investors who
asked for their money back could have it returned within days. And
while typical Ponzi schemes promise very high returns, Mr. Madoff’s
promised returns were relatively realistic — about 10 percent a year —
though they were unrealistically steady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/13/business/13fraud.html?hp&quot;&gt;this scheme&lt;/a&gt; went on for &amp;quot;years or even decades,&amp;quot; which means it lasted longer than many legitimate concerns.&amp;nbsp; Nomura had been searching out international clients for him.&amp;nbsp; Checks and balances were weak:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...because he had his own securities firm, Mr. Madoff kept custody
over his clients’ accounts and processed all their stock trades
himself. His only check appears to have been Friehling &amp;amp; Horowitz,
a tiny auditing firm based in New City, N.Y. Wealthy individuals and
other money managers entrusted billions of dollars to funds that in
turn invested in his firm, based on his reputation and reported
returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality the &amp;quot;fund&amp;quot; simply was not there and now grandmothers have been fleeced.&amp;nbsp; That is a scary lesson about the financial sector as a whole (and prudential regulation) but if it is any comfort an unregulated hedge fund could not have done the same.&amp;nbsp; Those funds hold their portfolios at banks and thus you can check as to whether they actually &amp;quot;exist.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Jason Shafrin, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://healthcare-economist.com/&quot;&gt;Healthcare Economist&lt;/a&gt;, has a nice post explaining how a statistical illusion can make early screening for disease appear much more effective than it really is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is an example using the dreaded disease &lt;em&gt;economicitis&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Let us 
divide people into 3 groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthy&lt;/strong&gt;: You live forever. 
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st stage &lt;em&gt;economicitis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is asymptomatic. Life 
expectancy when 1st stage economicitis begins is 10 years.&amp;nbsp; One half of 
&lt;em&gt;economicisits&lt;/em&gt; cases are 1st stage. 
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd stage &lt;em&gt;economicitis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; appears when individuals 
mysteriously grow a third or possibly fourth hand.&amp;nbsp; Life expectancy with second 
stage &lt;em&gt;economicitis&lt;/em&gt; is 2 years.&amp;nbsp; One half of &lt;em&gt;economicitis&lt;/em&gt; cases 
are 2nd stage. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before any screening was developed, individuals would learn they had 
 &lt;em&gt;economicitis&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp; when they started growing extra hands.&amp;nbsp; Thus, documented 
life expectancy for those with&amp;nbsp; &lt;em&gt;economicitis&lt;/em&gt; was 2 years, since all 
individuals who were recorded as having&amp;nbsp; &lt;em&gt;economicitis&lt;/em&gt; were in the 2nd 
stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us assume that a screening technique is now available.&amp;nbsp; If the screening 
device is able to detect 100% of stage 1 and stage 2 &lt;em&gt;economicitis&lt;/em&gt; 
cases, then we will see that life expectancy will increased to 6 years 
(10/2+2/2=6). Statisticians looking at the data may claim the following: “The 
&lt;em&gt;economicitis&lt;/em&gt; screening test has increased life expectancy after 
diagnosis from 2 to 6 years!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This claim, however, is false since there is no effective treatment for&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;em&gt;economicitis&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The increase in average life expectancy is not due to 
any improvement in health care, but only because the relatively healthier 
individuals with 1st stage &lt;em&gt;economicitis&lt;/em&gt; are now being detected by the 
test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, David Plotkin had a article in The Atlantic dealing with this issue and others with respect to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/96jun/cancer/cancer.htm&quot;&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The statistics are somewhat out of date but the article remains of real value.&lt;br /&gt;

<title>How to spend the stimulus</title>

<description>Here is a NYT symposium of economists, including yours truly. I very much like Andrew Samwick&#39;s point:If I had my druthers, the word ’stimulus’ would be expunged from public discussion, along with ‘bailout’ and ‘rescue.’ These words convey the idea...</description>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here is &lt;a href=&quot;http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/12/the-ideal-stimulus-package/&quot;&gt;a NYT symposium of economists&lt;/a&gt;, including yours truly.&amp;nbsp; I very much like Andrew Samwick&#39;s point:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I had my druthers, the word ’stimulus’ would be expunged from
public discussion, along with ‘bailout’ and ‘rescue.’ These words
convey the idea that, because we have so mismanaged our economic and
financial affairs, we are somehow able or entitled to conjure up
additional funds out of thin air to fix our problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, here is &lt;a href=&quot;http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/12/tracking_tarp.php&quot;&gt;a passage from Megan McArdle&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the government going to guarantee approximately 70 million
owner-occupied homes in America against a 25% price drop?&amp;nbsp; No, because
that&#39;s $3.5 trillion dollars, if my mental arithmetic serves.&amp;nbsp; Or is it
only going to give the money to the least responsible homeowners:&amp;nbsp; the
ones with small (or no) downpayments, houses they could only afford at
short-term teaser rates, and a long string of missed payments?&amp;nbsp; The
numbers, and the political arithmetic, don&#39;t add up.&amp;nbsp; Indeed, any such
program would positively encourage people to default, in order to get
the government to cram down their loans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, don&#39;t spend the stimulus on the housing market.&amp;nbsp; From another angle, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mungowitzend.blogspot.com/2008/12/why-is-it-surprising-that-tax-cuts-have.html&quot;&gt;Angus reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess I&#39;d rather give my money to people who are going to use it to
try to make more money (i.e. save/spend it in the market system) than
give it to people who are going to use it to try and get re-elected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/12/case-for-payroll-tax-cut.html&quot;&gt;more from Greg Mankiw&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A Slate reader &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/id/2206463/&quot;&gt;writes in to Prudie&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My dear, highly educated husband has written a book. While he has many
talents, writing isn&#39;t among them. He paid someone to edit the book,
which helped it somewhat, but it&#39;s still awful. I&#39;ve gone through it as
well and cleaned it up the best I could without completely rewriting
it. The problem is my attitude—I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s my place to crush my
husband&#39;s dream but find it hard to just sit there with a smile on my
face while he goes on and on about how life will change when he&#39;s a
best-selling author. It&#39;s not going to happen. I realize that at one
point a publisher (or a stack of rejection letters) will make the point
without me doing so, but I&#39;m not quite sure how to act now. I love him
and want to be supportive of him following his dreams, but I don&#39;t want
him to waste his time. Do I stand by and lie, or break the news to him

<content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of 51 countries that have received reward payments since 1999, six
overestimated their immunization gains by a factor of four, 10
overestimated them by a factor of two, and 23 by less than two. Eight
underestimated their progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/11/AR2008121103318.html&quot;&gt;the article&lt;/a&gt;, interesting throughout.&amp;nbsp; The bottom line is this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1986, progress in childhood immunization in the developing world
has been about half that officially reported by governments in the
developing world. Not only are year-to-year improvements overstated,
but the total percentage of children immunized is far lower than
publicly acknowledged, the study found.

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span face=&quot;PrimaSans BT,Verdana,sans-serif&quot;&gt;You may have heard about the recent study by Mark Kishiyama et.al. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-12-07-childrens-brains_N.htm&quot;&gt;described by USA Today as follows&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study finds that certain brain functions of some low-income 9-
and 10-year-olds pale in comparison with those of wealthy children and
that the difference is almost equivalent to the damage from a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is &lt;a href=&quot;http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/booster_shots/2008/12/family-income-k.html&quot;&gt;more detail&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...[they] rigged up the noggins of 26 kids -- with an average age of 9.5 years --
with probes that sense the ebb and flow of electrical current in
different regions of the brain. Then, they put them through a battery
of neuropsychological tests. Half of the kids came from families with
annual incomes that averaged just over $27,000 and generally had low
levels of parental education; the other half came from families where a
primary caregiver had completed at least four years of college and in
which annual household income averaged a little more than $97,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span face=&quot;PrimaSans BT,Verdana,sans-serif&quot;&gt;The paper is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18752394&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Who better to ask about this than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/cv.html&quot;&gt;Michelle Dawson&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;nbsp; Michelle wrote to me:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span face=&quot;PrimaSans BT,Verdana,sans-serif&quot;&gt;I read the poor vs rich
kids brains study (Kishiyama et al.). It&#39;s a very small study (13 in
each group) and the groups aren&#39;t matched on ethnicity. In the major
task (the one which got media attention), where the authors looked at
ERPs [TC: here is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-related_potential&quot;&gt;a link on ERP&lt;/a&gt;], the performance of the two groups was the same. The performance
of the two groups on a Stroop task, a classic test of what the poor
kids are said to be incapable of, was also the same. The major
performance difference between groups was on vocabulary (the WISC-III
vocabulary test), but only a few tests were used. There was no attempt
to match the groups on IQ. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span face=&quot;PrimaSans BT,Verdana,sans-serif&quot;&gt;Just to repeat two key points: a) the observed difference in electrical current patterns may depend on IQ differences, not poverty, and b)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;on the actual major task the poor kids did just as well&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp; There are tasks where the poor children do less well but this is hardly news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular science reporting on neuro issues is very often not to be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum&lt;/strong&gt;: There is more from Michelle Dawson in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An ill-timed increase in the regulatory burden is on the way.&amp;nbsp; Kathleen Fasanella &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fashion-incubator.com/archive/national-bankruptcy-day/&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122696993087535701.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;, Rick Woldenberg was quoted as describing February 10, 2009 as National Bankruptcy Day because that’s the day when &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fashion-incubator.com/archive/new-product-safety-regulations-that-affect-all-manufacturers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many of us will go out of business&lt;/a&gt; due to the implementation of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fashion-incubator.com/archive/cpsia-requirements/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CPSIA Regulations&lt;/a&gt;... Come
February 10th, a lot of people will be hit hard by reality when their
products are returned or their financing is declined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap, this law was passed (424 votes to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pensitoreview.com/2008/07/31/dr-ron-paul-casts-only-vote-against-lead-in-toys-ban/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;) to protect children from unsafe toys after last year’s widely publicized recalls (by the way, recalls have actually &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/12/AR2008111203115.html?nav=rss_health&amp;amp;referer=sphere_related_content&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;decreased by 46%&lt;/a&gt;). What few consumers realize is this legislation affects &lt;strong&gt;more than toys&lt;/strong&gt;.
What few clothing manufacturers realize is this also affects them. Of
the ones who do know, most of them think it only applies to children’s
clothes. Other than apparel the law includes diapers, blankets
(housewares), books, videos, computer and electronic products,
strollers, cribs, car seats, and anything humans come in contact with
in their environment. Our objections are not higher standards for
product safety or even the costs involved per se. The problem is&lt;strong&gt; Congress wrote the law and forced the CPSC to implement it before the regulations were written&lt;/strong&gt;. These regulations are not written by people who are familiar with manufacturing and thus, impose unnecessary burdens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fashion-incubator.com/archive/cpsia-and-small-manufacturers/&quot;&gt;understand this correctly&lt;/a&gt;, all sorts of small manufacturers have to vouch that their products do not contain much lead, yet &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zianet.com/ehusman/weblog/2008/12/in-which-30-thousand-small.html&quot;&gt;such a claim is not easy to know or verify&lt;/a&gt; (does your product have paint?).&amp;nbsp; You can follow the story &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fashion-incubator.com/&quot;&gt;at Kathleen&#39;s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Here is &lt;a href=&quot;http://nationalbankruptcyday.com/archive/video-testimony/&quot;&gt;video testimony&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Eric H. points out to me: &lt;span face=&quot;PrimaSans BT,Verdana,sans-serif&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;It is &amp;quot;I, Pencil&amp;quot; meets &amp;quot;I, illegal paperclip&amp;quot; (yeah, really).&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
